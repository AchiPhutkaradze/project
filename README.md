# Project Structure

## HTML (index.html) Structure:

### Elements Used:

In the HTML file, I've utilized the following main tags:

- nav
- header
- main
- section
- footer
- div

### Classes and IDs:

To organize elements with similar styles, I've assigned classes. Additionally, I've used IDs to target specific elements for styling purposes.

### Usage:

1. **<nav>:** Used for navigation menus, providing easy access to different sections of the website.
2. **<header>:** Contains introductory content or branding elements such as logos or titles.
3. **<main>:** Houses the main content of the webpage, encompassing various sections.
4. **<section>:** Divides the content into distinct sections, each focusing on a specific topic or theme.
5. **<footer>:** Includes footer content such as copyright information, contact details, or additional links.
6. **<div>:** Used for grouping and organizing content within sections or for applying specific styles.

## CSS (style.css) Styling:

### Techniques Used:

In the style.css file, I've employed the following techniques to enhance layout and visual appeal:

- _Flexbox and Grid Layout:_ Utilized to create a structured and organized layout, optimizing content distribution across various sections of the website.
- _Media Queries:_ Implemented to ensure a responsive design, providing a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and devices.
- _Transition and Transform:_ Integrated to enhance the visual aesthetics, creating smooth animations and transformations for interactive elements.

### Usage:

1. _Flexbox and Grid Layout:_ Arrange elements within sections and across the page to achieve desired layouts.
2. _Media Queries:_ Adjust styles based on screen width, ensuring readability and usability on various devices.
3. _Transition and Transform:_ Apply visual effects to elements, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

## JavaScript (script.js) Functionality:

### Features Implemented:

Within the script.js file, I've incorporated the following features to enhance interactivity and user engagement:

- _Functions:_ Defined to execute specific tasks and actions within the website, ensuring smooth functionality.
- _Event Listeners:_ Utilized to detect and respond to user actions, such as clicks on menu icons, buttons, or interactions with the FAQ section.
- _Enhanced User Experience:_ By reacting to user inputs, these functionalities contribute to a more dynamic and user-friendly browsing experience.

### Usage:

1. _Functions:_ Execute tasks and operations, such as handling user input or updating content dynamically.
2. _Event Listeners:_ Detect user actions and trigger appropriate responses, enabling interactive behavior.
